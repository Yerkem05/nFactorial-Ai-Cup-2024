## < AI-powered doctor app. Users can upload their medical analyses, and the app will diagnose their conditions using text and image recognition. It will also serve as an assistant if further analyses are needed. This idea could make a significant impact here in Kazakhstan, where we have a limited number of doctors who are always booked. Consulting with a doctor is expensive and time-consuming, so the app would help reduce the workload for these busy professionals and save patients both time and money by providing quick, reliable diagnoses and prescriptions. >
